			<img src="./img/intel2.png" class="right" alt="xeon_2">High-speed analytics operating on large, fast-moving data sets is changing the way businesses compete. From core
business transactions to social media posts, all relevant data can now be analyzed almost instantly and the insights
can be integrated into real-time processes. <br>The beneﬁts are potentially transformative. From front-line sales teams
to customer-facing applications, businesses can respond faster and more intelligently to drive better results, deliver
new services and experiences, and implement new revenue-generating business models.<br>
Four-socket, eight-socket, and larger servers based on the lntelﬁ’ Xeon" processor E7-8800/4400 v4 product families
provide exceptional performance and scalability for real-time business. With their massive execution resources,
large memory capacity, and advanced reliability features, these servers are ideal for high-speed analytics operating
on multi-terabyte datasets.<br>They also provide a robust foundation for enterprise applications, such as enterprise
resource planning (ERP), data warehousing, and online transaction processing (OLTP).
<br><br>Servers based on this new processorfamily can help you virtualize demanding workloads and move them into
private or hybrid clouds to bring higher agility, efﬁciency, and resilience into your mission-critical environments.
lntelﬁ’ Resource Director Technology provides deep insight and control over shared platform resources, such as
cache and system memory, so you can balance workloads more efﬁciently and prioritize performance and uptime
for your most critical applications.
